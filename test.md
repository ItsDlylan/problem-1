Create a short, high-impact Hackathon Pitch Deck for a project called MedAI, a product built during a hackathon to revolutionize hospital scheduling with AI.
The presentation should look modern, futuristic, and healthcare-friendly — using clean design, minimal text, and visuals that convey automation, empathy, and efficiency.
🎯 Tone & Style
Energetic, concise, and demo-oriented
Blue/white color palette with light gradients (trust + innovation)
Use icons or flow visuals instead of paragraphs
Keep it to 8–9 slides total
⏱️ Timing: 1.5 minutes for slides + 3 minutes for live demo = 4.5 minutes total
Each slide should feel fast-paced but clear — every visual should support the spoken story
Slides are quick setup, demo is the star of the show
